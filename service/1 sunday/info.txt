440 hours (6 per week this school year--4 for teaching, 2 for prep)

STEM Learning Group--teaching classes on math/programming to elementary/middle schoolers, free from charge other than an optional donation to (a) keep them accountable and (b) help mitigate the farmer crisis

Grades 9, 10, 11--goes back to middle school but I haven't counted the hours back then
